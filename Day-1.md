# 📘 Day 1 – Arrays & Two-Pointer Technique
# 🗓️ Date: 27 June 2025
# 🎯 Focus Areas: Arrays, Two-Pointer Technique

# ✅ Problems Solved:
27. Remove Element.
26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array.
80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II.

# 🧠 What I Learned:
How to remove elements or duplicates in-place using two pointers.
Importance of handling array bounds and updating the correct index.
Learned to rethink my logic when stuck, instead of rushing to a solution.
Got better at writing cleaner code and understanding how k (the write pointer) should behave.

# 🛠️ Techniques Practiced:
Two-pointer approach (i for reading, k for writing).
In-place array modifications.
Dealing with conditions like nums[i] != nums[k-2] to limit repetitions.

# 💬 Reflection:
I felt stuck a couple of times, especially when checking conditions for duplicates in Problem 80. Instead of copying the solution, I took a short break, walked through test cases on paper, and restructured my approach. This made the logic clearer and gave me more confidence.

Looking forward to building on this tomorrow. ✌️
