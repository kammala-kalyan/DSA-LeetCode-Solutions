# 📚 LeetCode Daily Practice – by Kammala Kalyan

Hey! 👋
This is where I’m uploading all the LeetCode problems I solve every day. I'm currently focusing on improving my problem-solving skills, especially in Java, and using this repo to keep track of my consistency and progress.

# 📌 Why I Made This Repo:
⚫ To build a habit of solving problems daily 🧠.

⚫ To revise and organize all my solved problems in one place 📂.

⚫ To create a small portfolio I can share on LinkedIn and during interviews 💼.



# 💻 What's Inside:
⚫ My Java solutions to LeetCode problems.

⚫ Proper filenames with problem numbers and titles.

⚫ Short comments or explanations (I try to keep them simple).

⚫ Time and space complexity.


# 📘 Day 1 – Arrays & Two-Pointer Technique

🗓️ Date: 27 June 2025

🎯 Focus Areas: Arrays, Two-Pointer Technique


# ✅ Problems Solved:

27. Remove Element.

26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array.

80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II.

# 🧠 What I Learned:

How to remove elements or duplicates in-place using two pointers.

Importance of handling array bounds and updating the correct index.

Learned to rethink my logic when stuck, instead of rushing to a solution.

Got better at writing cleaner code and understanding how k (the write pointer) should behave.


# 🛠️ Techniques Practiced:

Two-pointer approach (i for reading, k for writing).

In-place array modifications.

Dealing with conditions like nums[i] != nums[k-2] to limit repetitions.

# 💬 Reflection:

I felt stuck a couple of times, especially when checking conditions for duplicates in Problem 80. Instead of copying the solution, I took a short break, walked through test cases on paper, and restructured my approach. This made the logic clearer and gave me more confidence.

Looking forward to building on this tomorrow. ✌️
